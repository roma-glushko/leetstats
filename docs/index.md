# LeetStats

!!! quote "Quote"

    LeetCode is for Computer Science, LeetStats is for **Applied Statistics**.

LeetStats is an open source, curated collection of standalone problems and small projects
to train you how to apply statistics and work with uncertainty.

Our goal is to go beyond the traditional textbook exercises, where you basically need 
to extract context from the problem definition and apply a formula, and push you 
to learn to frame problems in terms of statistics.

## Get Started

Check out the list of [problems](/problems), pick the one that interest you and start solving.

## Have a good problem?

If you have a good problem that you think would be a good fit for LeetStats, we would really like you to share it with us.

LeetStats have two problem templates to keep our problem statements as consistent as possible:

- [The generic problem template](/templates/problem.template.md) for most of the problems.
- [The dataset problem template](/templates/dataset-problem.template.md) for problems that involves analysis of a dataset.

Pick the template that fits your problem type first, fill with the available information and create a pull request into [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/roma-glushko/leetstats).

## Community Solutions

Solved a good portion of our problems and have your own repository with solutions?
Let us know, we would like to feature it in [our community solutions gallery]()!
