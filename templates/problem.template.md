{Problem Description}

## Examples

{[Optional] List a few examples to illustrate the input that the solution should process}

Example 1:

```plain
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

## Constraints

{[Optional] Any constraints that we need our students to consider?}

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Hints

{[Optional] A list of hints that should help the students to solve the problem when they are stuck. It should not directly talk about solution but rather push them in the right direction}

## Followups

{[Optional] A list of followup little tasks or questions that can spice up the original problem}

## Credits

{[Optional] Give credit to the original source of the problem}

## Similar Problems
